# brief6

in this project, 
i put myself to the test of how to handle more than one table on a database, so configuring how to.

about the main idea :
its all about the CRUD principal, in which we CREATE READ USE and DELETE data, 
we mimic the idea of a product managing system(product is Cars)

the admin is able to add see find delete products(car)
____________________ add see find delete Category
listing products(car) under one category

So i mentions before that i need to create and/or manage two tables in a database,
here's the [dataset](https://github.com/Elon-Fask/brief6/blob/main/dataset.sql)


## Preview
####  - we run the file main.java 
![main.java](/img/Screenshot%20from%202022-06-07%2011-51-59.png)
#### - we choose an operation 
![](/img/Screenshot%20from%202022-06-07%2011-52-14.png)

#### - then we are free to add create see and or delete products(car) or Category
